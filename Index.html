                    <p>A developer should not depend on his active income only! He must take care of his health, but still he may become sick & loss his job. But he must not remain incomeless in that period. To do so, he must build a product such as he may build a WordPress Theme and sell it on Themeforest and similar markets. Therefore, a passive income will be kept generating.</p>
